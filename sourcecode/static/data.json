The Top Boost feature proved popular enough that it became standard on the AC30/6 (so named for its six inputs).

Since then, the Dual Rectifier has become one of the most popular rock amps on the planet.\r\nDesigned by Mesa founder Randall Smith, the amp uses silicone diodes that give it a gain level and feeling all its own.
